# Pygame Practice
This is my iteration on a video series by **Tech with Tim** on [Pygame](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6xMBig-pP4&list=PLzMcBGfZo4-lp3jAExUCewBfMx3UZFkh5).

## Features
This project is exactly like the project that will reult from Tim's videos, however, with better media management and more bugs fixed.

what soecifically is inlcuded in this project in addition to Tim's are:
- All of the media files are stored within their own folder rather than in the same folder as the code
- Bug fixed where the bullet would still "hit" a goblin even when the goblin is invisible
- Bug fix where the bullet can turn back around when the character also turns, which does not seem feasable

### Requirements
requirements include:
- Python
- PyGame

## What I've learned from this project
- The basics of PyGame
- Better understanding on how **Classes** and **Objects** work
- Understanding what `self` is and how `self` can bee used such as `self.x`
